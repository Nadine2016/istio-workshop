# Exercise 1 - Accessing a Kubernetes cluster with IBM Cloud Container Service

Your IBM Cloud paid account and your Kubernetes cluster have been pre-provisioned for you. Here are the steps to access your cluster:

### Installing the IBM Cloud Container Service command line utilities

1. Install the IBM Cloud [command line interface](https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html).

2. Log in to the IBM Cloud CLI with your user name and api key:   
 Â  ```
   bx login -u ibmcloudxx@us.ibm.com --apikey xxxx
   ```

3. Install the IBM Cloud Container Service plug-in.
   ```
   bx plugin install container-service -r Bluemix
   ```

4. Verify that the plug-in is installed properly
   ```
   bx plugin list
   ```
   The container service plug-in is displayed in the results as `container-service`.

5. Initialize the container service plug-in and point the API endpoint to the us-east region.   
   ```
   bx cs region-set us-east
   ```

6. Install the Kubernetes CLI. Go to the [Kubernetes page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-via-curl) to install the CLI and follow the steps.


### Accessing your cluster

1. Set the context for your cluster in your CLI. Every time you log in to the IBM Cloud Container Service CLI to work with your cluster, you must run these commands to set the path to the cluster's configuration file as a session variable. The Kubernetes CLI uses this variable to find a local configuration file and certificates that are necessary to connect with the cluster in IBM Cloud.

    a. List available clusters. You should see the cluster `guestbook`.
    
    ```bash
    bx cs clusters
    ```
    
    b. Download the configuration file and certificates for your `guestbook` cluster.
    
    ```bash
    bx cs cluster-config guestbook
    ```
    
    c. Copy and paste the output command from the previous step to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and configure your CLI to run `kubectl` commands against your cluster.

2. Create a proxy to your Kubernetes API server.

    ```
    kubectl proxy
    ```
    
3. In a browser, go to http://localhost:8001/ui to access the API server dashboard.   

4. View the details of your cluster.
    ```
    bx cs cluster-get guestbook
    ```

5. Verify the worker nodes in the cluster.   
    ```
    bx cs workers guestbook
    bx cs worker-get [worker_id]
    ```
### Cloning the lab Github repo

1. Clone the repo.
   ```    
   git clone https://github.com/szihai/istio-workshop.git 
   ```
   
2. Navigate in to the working directory for the lab. 
   ```
   cd istio-workshop
   ```
